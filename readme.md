#Basic AI Examples

This is a collection of basic samples that progressively add more complexity.  Most of the samples use LangChain.  The goal is to progressively cover topics from simple model io, to splitting text and creating embeddings, to interacting with a vector store and doing semantic search, to building out custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using a variety of combinations of embedding libraries, vector stores, and LLMs.
